#For this task I will need to convert and cast different variables. I have assigned the variables below in order to get started with the task.
#num1 will need to become an integer.
num1=99.23
#num2 will need to become a float.
num2=23
#num3 will need to become a string.
num3=150
#string1 will need to become an integer.
string1=100
#I will need to convert the variables above by doing what is known as casting.
#In order to show the difference I will print both as to visualise the change.
#I am using the print("") command to space everything out. This will make the output easier on the eye.
#I am also displaying both as it should help the end user to see what is happening, for instance when 'num1' is printed it reads 99.23.
#When converted to an integer this becomes 99.
print("")
print("Below is 'num1':")
print(num1)
print("When converted to an integer this becomes:")
#I am using the int() function as this will allow me to convert 'num1' into an integer.
print(int(num1))

print("")
print("Below is 'num2':")
print(num2)
print("When converted to an float this becomes:")
#I am using the float() function as this will allow me to convert 'num2' into an float.
print(float(num2))

print("")
print("Below is 'num3':")
print(num3)
print("When converted to an string this becomes:")
#I am using the str() function as this will allow me to convert 'num3' into an string.
print(str(num3))

print("")
print("Below is 'string1':")
print(string1)
print("When converted to an integer this becomes:")
#I am using the int() function as this will allow me to convert 'string1' into an integer.

#I will list each one out below when converted as this is asked of me in the task sheet.
